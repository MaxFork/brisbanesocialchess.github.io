            <h3>May 2025 â€“ Committee Meeting</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Present:</strong> Jimmy, Steve, Rob, Matt<br />
              <strong>Apologies:</strong> Ben
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Need to either lodge an annual Not For Profit (NFP) self-review return to confirm eligibility for income tax exemption or cancel ABN.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Rob advised that this is a statutory requirement.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Rob noted that for non-profit organisations the return is fairly easy, an office bearer must lodge and can do so on-line, via mail or by phone. There are a few quirks to the "how to lodge" process.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The alternative is to cancel our ABN which could be appropriate as BSC has effectively not engaged in profit making business over the last 12 months.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Matt noted that an ABN is required to apply for grants.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Matt advised his tax agent is progressing an NFP on behalf of BSC.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The committee discussed the pros and cons of continuing the ABN.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A vote of the committee unanimously agreed to continue the ABN.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Preparation for the Annual General Meeting.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Steve suggested that some early preparation for our next AGM would make the process easier.
                  </ul>
                  <li>
                    Steve suggested that a list of tasks with identified responsibilities would be useful as would an early forecast of a date.
                  </ul>
                  <li>
                    Rob stated that he would prepare accounts again after the end of the financial year.
                  </ul>
                  <li>
                    Rob noted that there would need to be a call for nominations to office bearers and suggested that it would be ideal to prepare for actual elections should more than one candidate nominate.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Business cards.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Matt noted that it is possible to get 250 business cards for about $100.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Rob noted the need to decide what goes on the card and that there is no BSC logo or phone number.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Matt suggested that contact could be via MeetUp as there are 14 people who can respond.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Steve asked if it was appropriate that any of the MeetUp contacts could respond to business enquiries without necessarily knowing the BSC committee view.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Matt wondered if we could use email however noted that this then required monitoring of the email account.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    General discussion considered that business cards were a good idea however some details need to be worked out.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                General Business.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    After some issues with payment of membership the status of Ben as a committee member in terms of the BSC constitution was discussed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Matt moved that Ben be re-appointed to the committee, seconded by Steve and unanimously agreed.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              <strong>Next meeting</strong> in 2 months, Jimmy to advise of a suitable date.
